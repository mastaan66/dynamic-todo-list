## Simple Dynamic To-Do List with HTML, CSS & JavaScript

This project implements a basic to-do list application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can add new tasks, mark them as complete.

### Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

### Functionality

* **Add Tasks:** Enter a new task description in the input field and click the "Add" button. The task will be appended to the list.
* **Mark Tasks Complete:** Click on a task to mark it as complete. Completed tasks are visually distinguished (e.g., strikethrough text).

### Technologies Used

* HTML: Defines the structure and content of the web page.
* CSS: Styles the visual appearance of the elements.
* JavaScript: Adds interactivity to the application by handling user actions and updating the to-do list dynamically.

### Further Enhancements

This is a basic implementation. Here are some ideas for further development:
* **Clear List:** Click the "Clear All" button to remove all tasks from the list.
* **Persistence:** Save the to-do list data in local storage or a database so it persists after the browser is refreshed.
* **Prioritization:** Allow users to prioritize tasks (e.g., high, medium, low).
* **Editing Tasks:** Enable users to edit existing tasks.
* **Filtering:** Implement filtering options to categorize or search for specific tasks.
